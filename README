Notes
   HPCM PBS Professional Connector is supported on both Flat and Hierarchical systems.
   High Availability configuration of PBS Pro is supported.
   Provisioning of nodes is now supported using latest APIs.


Prerequisites
   PBS Professional deployment on a non HPCM Admin Node
   - PBS Professional Server/Scheduler is installed on the non CMU Management Node
   - PBS Professional Client commands are installed on the CMU Management Node.
   - PBS Professional MOM is installed in HPCM image_groups (os images).
   - Passwordless SSH from Node running PBS to Node running HPCM for root only. This is required for provisioing.

   PBS Professional deployment on a CMU Management Node
   - PBS Professional Server/Scheduler is installed on the CMU Management Node
   - PBS Professional MOM is installed in HPCM image_groups (os images)

   High Availability deployment
   - Refer PBS Professional Admin Guide on how to setup HA.
   - /etc/pbs.conf file on all nodes should be the consistent. (be specific here)


Installation Instructions
On the Admin Node do the following:

1. Copy hpcm_pbspro_connector tarball to /opt/clmgr/contrib

cp hpcm_pbspro_connector*.tar.gz /opt/clmgr/contrib

2. Change directory to /opt/clmgr/contrib

cd /opt/clmgr/contrib

3. Unpackage hpcm_pbspro_connector tarball

tar zxvf hpcm_pbspro_connector*.tar.gz

4. Update /opt/clmgr/etc/ActionAndAlertsFile.txt w/ the PBS_Specific_ActionAndAlerts.txt
   NOTE: File contains PBS Professional specific configurations that need to be incorporated in /opt/clmgr/etc/ActionAndAlertsFile.txt file.

MANUALLY ADDED PBS PROFESSIONAL SPECIFIC CONTENT TO THE DESIGNATED AREAS OF THE FILE.

5. Update /opt/clmgr/etc/cmu_custom_menu w/ the PBS_Specific_hpcm_custom_menu
   NOTE: File contains PBS Professional specific configurations that need to be incorporated in /opt/clmgr/etc/cmu_custom_menu

mv ../etc/cmu_custom_menu ../etc/cmu_custom_menu.orig
cat ../etc/cmu_custom_menu.orig hpcm_pbspro_connector/etc/PBS_Specific_hpcm_custom_menu > ../etc/cmu_custom_menu

6. Update /opt/clmgr/contrib/hpcm_pbspro_connector/etc/hpcm_pbs_os_provision_hook.json w/ the admin node name where HPCM is installed.
   NOTE: Config file contains name of admin node for PBS Pro to determine where HPCM module is installed. 

7. Restart CMU service for configuration to take effect

/etc/init.d/cmu restart


Configuration
   - By default, High Availability is not configured. Hence make sure Section for NON High Availability Configuration in cmu_custom_menu file is uncommented and Section for High Availability Configuration is commented out.
   If High Availability is configured, then comment out Section for NON High Availability Configuration in cmu_custom_menu file adn uncomment Section for High Availability Configuration.

   - You can optionally add managers to be able to make changes to the configuration by adding user to managers list as:
     qmgr -c "set server managers += <site_user_account>"


User Instructions
   - To be able to provision a node, new API requires kernal name, root file system type and node type to be provisioned along with the node name and AOE.

   - User need to provide kernal name, root fs type and node type via environment variable as described below while submitting a provisioning job.
     Supported nodes: compute, ice-compute and leader
     Supported root fs type: disk and ramfs

     Example:
     To request provisioning for node of type ice-compute and root filesystem type as ramfs, pass environment variables to qsub via -v option
     qsub -v PBS_HPCM_PROVTYPE=ice-compute -v PBS_HPCM_ROOTFS=ramfs -v PBS_HPCM_KERNAL=kernal-image-name

   - To view available kernal on the node, run pbsnodes -a command.
     As part of automatic configuration of HPCM PBS Professional Connector, kernal list is updated on the nodes in resources_available.kernal.
